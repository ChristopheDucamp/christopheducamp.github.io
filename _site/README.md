This Jekyll theme started as a port of [Cactus](https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus) to my own needs, but I ended up performing a lot more modifications than expected. Some people reached me out and asked if I could share it, so here we are.

#### Disclaimer: I'm only a designer, so please don't expect the code to be pretty.
